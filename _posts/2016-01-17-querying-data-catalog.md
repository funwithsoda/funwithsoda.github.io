Socrata provides a API for getting a list of Socrata datasets. Unfortunately for me the data is not as comprehensive as I'd like. For example it doesn't list the ID for SODA 2.1, number of rows, location of data owner, creation date, and number of updates.

# Basic steps

1. Download the list of datasets
2. Get the 2.1 SODA ID for each dataset
3. Get the location of each dataset owner
4. Run Count(*) on each dataset
